This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
You can open it on browser "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
With this application you can choose a date, save it by pressing submit button and see all saved dates below. By clicking one of the saved dates you can delete them easily.
For this project, I used NextJS, Prisma ORM, Bootstrap and Axios. 

I have only one css file because it is not too big project and I didn't want to use css modules and separate CSS files.
